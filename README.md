# Client-Server-Dashboard
A MongoDB dashboard application using Python, Dash, and Jupyter Notebook


# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When writing programs, I make sure to use naming conventions that are descriptive of the functionality while also kept short to reduce the cluttered view, and I use functions where they best fit to reduce on unnecessary code. This gives me an advantage to understand the structure of the code and make changes if needed when coming back to the project after some down time. I am also able to better use the resources of my projects code in this way. This CRUD python module coudld be modified to fit any client/server applications I may make in the future.


# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach problems in code as a computer scientist by first trying to understand where it is going wrong and when it is going wrong. This helps identify what the issue is and where to locate and fix it. There is always going to be issues in any code at some point and finding them and problem solving them is part of the work. The approach to this project has not been much different from past work. I work in a iterative approach by adding funcitonality as I continue to work on the project. I would first look into what the best options are before creating a database for a client. There are many choices that would better suit a situation.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists are simply put, problem solvers. We are given something to create and use varying languages to accomplish this and along the way we are constantly problem solving and finding better, faster, and more effective solutions. The work on this project might help a company save time doing their work.
